# Historical N1904 Feature Parity Plan

> Historical note: this document predates the current Stephens-based TF build

This document tracks progress toward feature parity between the TR Text-Fabric dataset and the N1904 dataset.

## Phase 1: Easy Word-Level Features

**Goal**: Add remaining word-level features that can be computed algorithmically.

### Features to Add

1. **bookshort** - Abbreviated book name
   - Source: Existing `book` column (already abbreviated)
   - Transform: Direct copy

2. **text** - Surface word form
   - Source: `unicode` feature
   - Transform: Direct copy (alias)

3. **normalized** - Unicode-normalized form
   - Source: `unicode` feature
   - Transform: Apply NFC normalization

4. **num** - Word position in verse
   - Source: `word_rank` column
   - Transform: Direct copy

5. **ref** - Reference string
   - Format: `{bookshort} {chapter}:{verse}!{num}`
   - Example: `MAT 1:1!1`

6. **id** - Unique word identifier
   - Format: `n{book_num:02d}{chapter:03d}{verse:03d}{num:03d}`
   - Example: `n40001001001` (Matthew 1:1 word 1)

7. **cls** - Word class
   - Source: `sp` feature
   - Transform: Map sp values to cls values (noun, verb, adj, etc.)

### Implementation

Script: `scripts/phase4/p4_01e_add_compat_features.py`

---

## Phase 2: Hard Word-Level Features (Lookup-Based)

**Goal**: Add features that require N1904 lookup tables.

### Features to Add

1. **trans** - Contextual English translation
   - Different from `gloss` - includes articles, prepositions in context
   - Source: Build lookup from N1904 (lemma, strong, context) -> trans
   - Coverage: Expected ~89% (aligned words only)

2. **domain** - Semantic domain codes
   - Format: Space-separated codes like `033005` or `010002 033003`
   - Source: Build lookup from N1904
   - Coverage: Expected ~89%

3. **typems** - Morphological subtype
   - Values: common, proper, ordinal, cardinal, etc.
   - Source: Build lookup from N1904 or derive from morph codes
   - Coverage: Expected ~89%

### Implementation

Script: `scripts/phase4/p4_01f_add_lookup_features.py`

---

## Phase 3: Hierarchical Structure

**Goal**: Add clause, phrase, sentence, and word-group nodes with their features.

### Option B: 100%-Aligned Verses Only

**Approach**: Only create syntactic structure for verses where ALL words align with N1904.

**Pros**:
- High confidence in structure accuracy
- No heuristic guesswork
- Clear provenance

**Cons**:
- Partial coverage (~60-70% of verses estimated)
- TR-only content remains flat
- Inconsistent dataset structure

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Identify verses with 100% word alignment
2. For each aligned verse:
   - Copy clause/phrase/wg structure from N1904
   - Remap node IDs to TR node space
   - Remap word slots to TR slots
3. Add `structure_source` feature to indicate provenance
4. Leave non-aligned verses without syntactic structure

### Option C: Full Structure with Heuristics

**Approach**: Attempt to adapt N1904 structures even with partial alignment.

**Pros**:
- More complete coverage
- All verses have some structure

**Cons**:
- Risk of incorrect structures
- Complex heuristics needed
- Harder to validate

**Implementation Steps**:

1. For 100%-aligned verses: Same as Option B
2. For partially-aligned verses:
   - Copy structure nodes that span only aligned words
   - For structure nodes with mixed alignment:
     - Option C1: Extend to include TR-only words (risky)
     - Option C2: Create partial structures, mark as incomplete
     - Option C3: Use NLP to generate structure for TR-only segments
3. Add confidence scores to structure nodes
4. Add `structure_source` feature (n1904/heuristic/nlp)

### Structure Features to Add

For clause/phrase/wg nodes:
- `clausetype` - Type of clause
- `cltype` - Clause type code
- `rela` - Relation to parent
- `typ` - Phrase type
- `rule` - Syntactic rule applied
- `junction` - Coordination type
- `domain` - Discourse domain

### Estimated Effort

| Option | Complexity | Coverage | Risk |
|--------|------------|----------|------|
| B | Medium | 60-70% | Low |
| C | High | 85-95% | Medium-High |

## Implementation Order

1. ✅ Phase 1a: translit, lemmatranslit, unaccent, after, ln (DONE)
2. ✅ Phase 1b: bookshort, text, normalized, num, ref, id, cls (DONE)
   `trailer` was later removed from the TF export because it is specific to the N1904 critical apparatus and not part of the supported TR feature surface.
3. ✅ Phase 2: trans, domain, typems (DONE - lookup-based)
4. ⬜ Phase 3: Hierarchical structure (Option B or C)
